## An application that allows us to add activities we should do by X time.

Another project has been completed, and I can see that each new one in this section is getting more and more difficult and requires more and more focus. In this project I had to help myself a little with the internet and uncle google because I didn't quite know how to start, how to separate classes and how it should look like in general (structure), but after getting to the point of localStorage it was going difficult, but at least moving forward. The moment when localStorage had to be implemented was the most difficult for me, and I had to "hire" chatGPT to help me explain some things and help me write some things so that everything would work and be efficient. I believe that with every next project will be easier for me (even though it will be more difficult :D) and I will not give up easily, because here the problem was that the maximum I was able to sit 4h, while usually I worked on this project 3h a day, even though I told myself every day that the next day I will sit longer on it. It was certainly a challenging project that brought me down to earth a bit, that I still have a long, but very long time ahead of me. On the other hand, I will follow it, because after all, I will not give up after such a period, right?
